I'm proud to finally have this done. It's not a whole lot to it, but it encapsulates what I know so far. It took me a while to figure out the contact form, but I think it works well enough to upload. The redirect on form submission didn't work for me too well when I first tried it, but I should receive the emails that get sent. If not, I included my contact information.
